# CS631 Web Project - Fall 2023

This is where we will keep a Wiki of our CS631 term project, including any relevant guides, references, instructions, source code, application files, schema diagrams, our final report, etc. Our presentation will be hosted on YouTube, though we should still be able to store a backup of the video file here as well.

Below is a guide on how to navigate this repository. I'm sure we will add more content than we originally anticipate, so please feel free to add more folders and update/add to this readme anytime!

---
	
 * **TASK TRACKER:** A place for us to track immediate and upcoming to-do's, as well as important dates and deadlines (including any periods of time where we may have reduced availability). For any assignments to be submitted, we'll track both hard deadlines (due dates for the class) and target delivery dates (self-imposed internal due dates to ensure anxiety-free assignment submission). 
	
* **REFERENCES:** Collection of useful articles, links, tutorials, etc. for various tools and methodologies we'll be using. Any useful learning resource or reference guide should go here.
	
* **Specifications:** Stores any written specifications for our DB or apps. Includes material from the professor (Canvas pages, app requirements, DB design specifications) and any development and/or testing specifications we create for ourselves.
	
* **Diagrams:** Stores any diagrams or flow charts used to describe our DB or apps.
	
* **Application Code:** Stores our main source code, as well as any other code snippets that might be useful.
	
* **SQL Query Backups:** Stores SQL queries for our schema (in case we ever need to rebuild it) or any other query we may want to easily access later.
	
* **Data Backups:** Stores data that can be imported into our DB (in case we ever need to rebuild it).
	
* **Access Info:** Stores info about how to access our DB or apps, any connection info that may be relevant, etc.
	
* **Report:** Stores a Markdown version of our final term project report. It will be converted to PDF once finalized.
	
* **Presentation:** Stores a backup of our term project presentation video, and a link to the relevant YouTube page.
