# Term Project Milestone 1

**DUE DATE: SUN, 11/05/23**
	
In Module 10, you will submit a typed project report along with a presentation of your application programs using Google Hangouts on Air.
			
Include, as an appendix, a list of the relational instances you have used to populate your database.
			
Together with your term project report, you will need to turn in your programs in hard copy form, and a sample output of the programs.
			
There are two milestones in this Module to evaluate your designs.
			
Complete the first milestone by posting your design solutions to this discussion board for your instructor to review. Design requirements are found at the following link:
			
[Database Design Requirements](1-DBDesignReqsFromCanvas.md)
			
Note both members of your group must post the group's design. You will only be able to see your peers' postings after each of you have submitted the design.
			
Your instructor will submit feedback to each group's postings in one week from this assignment's due date (See Schedule and Deadlines page). You will use this feedback to complete the next assignment, milestone 2, in this module.

# Term Project Milestone 2

**DUE DATE: SUN, 11/12/23**
	
This report should minimally cover a summary of the system requirements and any additions you may have made, the entity-relationship design, the (relational) logical database design, and the application program design. For each of these, you should identify the major design decisions that you faced and the design decisions that you made with justifications for those decisions.

# Term Project Presentation

**DUE DATE: SUN, 12/10/23**
	
Use this space to submit the link to your project presentation.

Each presentation should be 10-15 minutes in length, and you should treat this demonstration as if you were giving it to a customer. Show that the application is working, as well as any specific features that may set your group's database apart from the others.

The presentation will be viewable a clickable link, (ie Youtube). The leader should share this link with their partner, so that each group member can post to this discussion board and receive a grade.
		
You will only be able to see your peers' presentations after you post yours.  Empty posts will be given no points.
